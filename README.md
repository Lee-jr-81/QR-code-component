### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Initially i had created specific classes inside the div elements for the "top-section" and "bottom-section". This was un-necessary though as those two elements would automatically land on top of one another in a column arrangement.
